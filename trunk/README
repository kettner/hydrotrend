With this you should be able to compile HydroTrend:

1) Install cmake on your linux machine if you haven't installed it yet (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)

2) Than, in the hydrotrend root directory (hydrotrend-trunk-rxxx) make a '_build' folder (mkdir _build).

3) cd to the _build dir.

4) in the _build directory type the command: cmake ./..

5) Once that is finished, use the command in the same directory: make

6) cd ../data

7) cp -r input/ HYDRO_IN

8) mkdir HYDRO_OUTPUT

9) ../_build/run_hydrotrend -V (the -V (verbose) will generate some more information to your terminal, if you don't like that you can run it without the -V)



Feel free to contact me if you are having problems compiling the code: Albert Kettner (Kettner@colorado.edu)
