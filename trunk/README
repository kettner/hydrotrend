Make sure that the ASCII input files called "configure.in" and
"Makefile.am" have been converted with dos2unix.  End-of-line
characters will be of DOS type if any of these files are edited
edited with a Windows-based editor.  Source code files whose
names end in ".c" or ".h" seem to be okay.

Comment out the KSH line in Makefile.am.

Run these commands:

(1) touch README AUTHORS COPYING NEWS ChangeLog
(2) aclocal  (creates aclocal.m4)
(3) autoconf (creates configure from configure.in)
(4) automake --add-missing   (creates makefile.in from makefile.am)
(5) /bin/bash configure  (creates Makefile)
(6) make

Note:  To recompile after changes to source code, try:
       (1) rm *.o
       (2) make
