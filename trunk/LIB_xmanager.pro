; NAME:
;	XMANAGER
;
; PURPOSE:
;	Provide management for widgets client applications created using IDL.
;
; CATEGORY:
;	Widgets.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;	XMANAGER [, Name, ID]
;
; OPTIONAL INPUTS:
;	NAME:	A string giving the name of the application that is being
;		registered.
;  
;	ID:	The widget ID of the top level base of the new client.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;	BACKGROUND:
;		-------------------------------------------------------------
;		| PLEASE NOTE: This keyword is OBSOLETE. It's functionality |
;		| is provided by the TIMER keyword to the WIDGET_CONTROL    |
;		| procedure.                                                |
;		-------------------------------------------------------------
;
;	CATCH: If TRUE, tells XMANAGER to use CATCH when dispatching
;		widget events. If FALSE, CATCH is not used and execution
;		halts on error. The default is TRUE. If CATCH is specified,
;		the internal state of XMANAGER is updated and it returns
;		immediately without taking any further action. CATCH
;		is only effective if XMANAGER is blocking to dispatch
;		errors. If active command line event dispatching is in
;		use, it has no effect.
;
;	CLEANUP: This keyword contains a string that is the name of the
;		routine called when the widget dies.  If not specified,
;		no routine is called.  The cleanup routine must accept one 
;		parameter which is the widget id of the dying widget. This
;		routine is set as the KILL_NOTIFY routine for the widget.
;
;	EVENT_HANDLER: The name of the event handling routine that is to be
;		called when a widget event occurs in the registered
;		application. If this keyword is not supplied, the Xmanager
;		will construct a default name by adding the "_EVENT" suffix
;		to the NAME argument. See below for a more detailed
;		explanation.
;
;	GROUP_LEADER: The widget id of the group leader for the application
;		being registered.  When the leader dies, all widgets that have
;		that leader will also die.
;
;		For example, a widget that views a help file for a demo 
;		widget would have that demo widget as it's leader.  When
;		the help widget is registered, it sets the keyword 
;		GROUP_LEADER to the widget id of the demo widget. If 
;		the demo widget is destroyed, the help widget led by 
;		the it would be killed by the XMANAGER.
;
;	JUST_REG:	
;		This keyword tells the manager to just register the widget
;		but not to start doing the event processing.  This is useful
;		when you want to register a group of related top level widgets
;		but need to regain control immediately afterwards.
;
;		NOTE: JUST_REG does not do the same thing as NO_BLOCK. This is
;		explained in detail below under "SIDE EFFECTS".
;
;	 MODAL:
;		--------------------------------------------------------------
;		| PLEASE NOTE: This keyword is OBSOLETE. It's functionality  |
;		| is provided by the MODAL keyword to the WIDGET_BASE        |
;		| procedure.                                                 |
;		--------------------------------------------------------------
;
;		When this keyword is set, the widget that is being registered
;		traps all events and desensitizes all the other widgets.  It
;		is useful when input from the user is necessary before
;		continuing. Once the modal widget dies, the others are
;		resensitized and the normal event processing is restored.
;		XMANAGER is therefore using sensitivity to provide the
;		illusion of modality. The WIDGET_BASE keyword is a newer
;		IDL feature that provides the real thing.
;
;	NO_BLOCK: If set, tells XMANAGER that the registering client
;		does not require XMANAGER to block if active command line
;		event processing is available. If active command line
;		event processing is available *AND* every current XMANAGER
;		client specifies NO_BLOCK, then XMANAGER will not block
;		and the user will have access to the command line while
;		widget applications are running.
;
;		NOTE: NO_BLOCK does not do the same thing as JUST_REG. This is
;		explained in detail below under "SIDE EFFECTS".
;
; OUTPUTS:
;	No outputs.
;
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;	MANAGED
;	XMANAGER_LOCAL:
;		Common blocks used for module state maintenance. These common
;		blocks are considered private to this module and should not
;		be referenced outside RSI supplied routines. They are
;		subject to change without notice.
;	
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;
;    JUST_REG vs NO_BLOCK
;    --------------------
;       Although their names imply a similar function, the JUST_REG and
;	NO_BLOCK keywords perform very different services. It is important
;	to understand what they do and how they differ.
;
;       JUST_REG tells XMANAGER that it should simply register a client
;	and then return immediately. The result is that the client becomes
;	known to XMANAGER, and that future calls to XMANAGER will take this
;	client into account. Therefore, JUST_REG only controls how the
;	registering call to XMANAGER should behave. The registered client
;	can still be registered as requiring XMANAGER to block by not setting
;	NO_BLOCK. In this case, future calls to XMANAGER will block.
;
;	NO_BLOCK tells XMANAGER that the registered client does not
;	require XMANAGER to block if the command processing front end
;	is able to support active command line event processing (described
;	below). XMANAGER remembers this attribute of the client until
;	the client exits, even after the call to XMANAGER that registered the
;	client returns. NO_BLOCK is just a "vote" on how XMANAGER should
;	behave. The final decision is made by XMANAGER by considering the
;	NO_BLOCK attributes of all of its current clients as well as the
;	ability of the command front end in use to support the active command
;	line.
;
;    Blocking vs Non-blocking
;    ------------------------
;	The issue of blocking in XMANAGER requires some explanation.
;	IDL places incoming widget events into a queue of pending events.
;	The only way to get these events processed and dispatched is to
;	call the WIDGET_EVENT function. Arranging for WIDGET_EVENT to be
;	called properly is the primary job of XMANAGER. XMANAGER offers
;	two different modes of operation:
;
;	    - The first (outermost) XMANAGER processes events by calling
;	      WIDGET_EVENT as necessary until no managed clients remain on
;	      the screen. This is referred to as "blocking", because XMANAGER
;	      does not return to the caller until it is done, and the IDL
;	      command line is not available.
;
;	    - XMANAGER does not block, and instead, the part of IDL
;	      that reads command input also watches for widget events
;	      and calls WIDGET_EVENT as necessary while also reading
;	      command input. This is referred to as "non-blocking" or
;	      "active command line" mode.
;
;	The default is to block. However, if every currently active
;	application specified the NO_BLOCK keyword to XMANAGER, non-blocking
;	mode is used, if possible.
;
;	There are currently 5 separate IDL command input front end
;	implementations:
;
;		- Apple Macintosh IDE
;		- Microsoft Windows IDE
;		- Motif IDE (Unix and VMS)
;		- Unix plain tty
;		- VMS plain tty
;
;	Except for the VMS plain tty, all of these front ends are able to
;	support the non-blocking active command line. VMS users can have
;	an active command line by using the IDLde interface. The decision
;	on whether XMANAGER blocks to process widget events is determined
;	by the following rules, in order of precedence:
;
;	    - Use of the MODAL keyword will cause XMANAGER to block.
;	    - Setting JUST_REG to 1 ensures that XMANAGER will not block.
;	    - If using the VMS plain tty interface, XMANAGER will block.
;	    - If none of the previous rules apply, XMANAGER will block
;	      if any of its currently active clients were registered without
;	      specifying NO_BLOCK. If NO_BLOCK is specified for every client,
;	      XMANAGER will not block and will instead return and allow
;	      active command line processing to take place.
;
;	When possible, applications should set the NO_BLOCK keyword.
;	This allows the IDL command line to be active while events are
;	being processed, which is highly desirable.
;
;
; RESTRICTIONS:
;	The implementation of XMANAGER may change in the future. Details
;	of its internal implementation must not be relied upon --- only
;	its external definition can be considered stable.
;
;	XMANAGER uses several undocumented features provided by the
;	internal WIDGET routines. These features are private to RSI, and
;	are not guaranteed to remain in IDL or to remain unchanged. They
;	exist only to support XMANAGER and should not be used elsewhere:
;
;		WIDGET_CONTROL, /XMANAGER_ACTIVE_COMMAND
;		WIDGET_CONTROL, /MODAL
;		WIDGET_EVENT,   /BREAK_ON_EXPOSE
;		WIDGET_EVENT,   /EVENT_BREAK
;		WIDGET_EVENT,   /XMANAGER_BLOCK
;		WIDGET_INFO,    /XMANAGER_BLOCK
;
;	These features are undocumented because they are not considered
;	permanent. Research Systems reserves the right to remove or alter
;	these features at any time.
;
; EXAMPLE USE:
;	To create a widget named Example that is just a base widget with a done
;	button using the XMANAGER you would do the following:
;
;
;	;------ first - the event handler routine ------;
;
;     PRO example_event, ev			;this is the routine that 
;						;deals with the events in the 
;						;example widget.
;	
;	WIDGET_CONTROL, ev.id, GET_UVALUE = uv	;the uservalue is retrieved 
;						;from the widget where the 
;						;event occurred
;
;	if(uv eq 'DONE') then $			;if the event occurred in the
;	  WIDGET_CONTROL, ev.top, /DESTROY	;done button then kill the 
;     END					;widget example
;
;
;	;------ second - the main routine ------;
;
;     PRO example				;this is the main routine
;						;that builds the widget and
;						;registers it with the Xmanager
;	
;	base = WIDGET_BASE(TITLE = 'Example')	;first the base is created
;	
;	done = WIDGET_BUTTON(base, $		;next the done button is 
;			     TITLE = 'DONE', $	;created and it's user value
;			     UVALUE = 'DONE')	;set to "DONE"
;
;	WIDGET_CONTROL, base, /REALIZE		;the widget is realized
;
;	XManager, 'example', base		;finally the example widget
;						;is registered with the 
;						;Xmanager
;     END
;
;	notes:	First the event handler routine is listed.  The handler
;		routine has the same name as the main routine with the 
;		characters "_event" added.  If you would like to use another
;		event handler name, you would need to pass it's name in as
;		a string to the EVENT_HANDLER keyword.  Also notice that the
;		event routine is listed before the main routine.  This is 
;		because the compiler will not compile the event routine if
;		it was below the main routine.  This is only needed if both
;		routines reside in the same file and the file name is the same
;		as the main routine name with the ".pro" extension added.
;
;
; PROCEDURE:
;	When the first widget is registered, initialize the lists and then 
;	start processing events.  Continue registering widgets and dispatching
;	events until all the widgets have been destroyed.  When a widget is 
;	killed, destroy all widgets that list the destroyed widget as their 
;	leader, if any.
;
; RELATED FUNCTIONS AND PROCEDURES:
;	XREGISTERED, XMTOOL
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY: Written by Steve Richards, November, 1990
;	SMR, Mar,  1991	Added a cleanup routine keyword to allow dying
;	    widgets to clean themselves up when dying.
;	SMR, May,  1991 Fixed a bug found by Diane Parchomchuk where an error
;	    occurred when registering a widget  ight after destroying another.
;	SMR & ACY, July, 1991
;	    Fixed a bug found by Debra Wolkovitch where lone widgets being
;	    destroyed and new ones created caused problems.
;	SMR, Sept, 1991	Changed cleanup to use the new WIDGET_INFO routine.
;	SMR & ACY, Oct,  1991
;	    Fixed a bug where a background event that unregistered itself
;	    after a time would result in an XMANAGER error.
; 	SMR, Mar.  1992	Changed XMANAGER to use enhanced widget functions for
;	    event processing.
;	SMR, Nov.  1992 Changed modal widget handling allowing nesting of
;	    modal widgets.  The first modal desensitizes all current widgets
;	    and subsequent modals only desensitize the modal that called them.
;	JIY, Apr.  1993 Changed modal widget handling process to not run the
;	    event loop for nested modal widgets. Allowed for multiple modal
;	    widgets.
;	AB & SMR, 17 November 1993
;	    Added ID validity checking to desensitizing of modal widgets to
;	    fix a bug where already dead widgets were being accessed.
;	DJE, Feb, 1995
;	    Made it so that non-modal widgets created from a modal widget have
;	    events processed in the modal widget's event loop. This fixes a
;	    bug where xmanager wouldn't return immediately if there was a
;	    modal widget somewhere in the nesting, even though a non-modal
;	    widget was being added. The nesting level could get _very_ deep.
;	DJE, Apr 1995
;	    Pass a local variable to WIDGET_EVENT in the MODAL case, instead
;	    of passing the common block variable modalList. This avoids a bug
;	    where modalList gets changed behind WIDGET_EVENT's back.
;	DJE, Apr 1996
;	    Changes for handling asynchronous widget event dispatching.
;	    Complete rewrite. Background tasks are no longer supported. The
;	    MODAL keyword is now obsolete. Added CATCH and BLOCK keywords.
;	AB, May 1996
;	    Made changes so that XMANAGER always blocks under VMS with the
;	    non-GUI interface. This is due to the fact that the SMG$ system
;	    routines used by IDL in the plain tty case cannot support
;	    interleaving of X events with tty input.
;	AB, 9 January 1997
;	    Changed the meaning of the CATCH keyword so that catching is the
;	    default. Removed BLOCK and replaced with NO_BLOCK. Switched
;	    default action back to blocking from unblocking based on feedback
;	    from the IDL 5 beta. Added the ability to block only as long as a
;	    client without NO_BLOCK is running, and then revert to the active
;	    command line.
;	AB, 10 February 1997
;	    Cleaned up code to make it easier to understand and maintain.
;	    Also cleaned up the distinction between real modality (MODAL
;	    keyword to WIDGET_BASE) and XMANAGER's older fake modality
;	    (MODAL keyword to XMANAGER), and fixed bugs in the current
;	    implementation of fake modality.
