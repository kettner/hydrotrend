To Do:
------
3) finish the glossary
	copy ref's out of C&GS papers into code (ie. bedload ref)
	clean old variable names from *.h files (DONE 09/18/02)
	HydroSedload: 
	   units for trnfac and trneff
	   get a reference for the bedload equation
	   should Sed load coefficients for Qexceedgw be gw or rain

4) document the assumptions
	
8) Test if one of the include files can be removed from each subroutine.
	Do only a couple of variables cross over?

11) add T and P coherence to HydroWeather.c
	use Eric's coherence on day scrambler and my T&P generators
	add real weather generator?

18) Implement snthrm
	call from hydronival.c ?
	remove dryevap, percentgw ?

20) Testing needed:
	i) snow/rain on glacier

50) Rewrite code to get rid of the globaly variables.

51) Find a better way to calculate bedload. Bedload is now depending on Q, make
	it depending on velocity.

52)	Build a DEM read menu to calculate hypsometry, Hypso.file is now created by
	Rivertools.
	
57) Hydrotrend can't handle negative values in hypsometry file, For example a
	negative elevation due to an inner lake gives an error.
58)	Add delta routine to hydrotrend so output will be devided among a given number of 
	outlets.
	
Notes:
------
Tstdcorr in hydroweather => 0.5 of STD
TmaxSTD = 2.0
PmaxSTD = 3.0

Done:
-----
1) document max flood algorithim in qflood.c
2) document all the river & hydrotrend papers in hydrotrend.c
5) have chkdat, verify end of one epoch = begining of next
6) have hydrotrend.c do the year counting.
7) in hydroreadinput.c/hydrocheckinput
	convert raininm and rainstd from mm to m	
	convert totalarea from km^2 to m^2
	basinlgt convert from km to m
	alphag convert to m/d
	alphac convert to m/d
	alphagwe convert to m/d
	pcr convert to m/d
	ko convert to m/d
9) add fidlog output to hydrocheckinput.c 
10) HydroTrend: add baseflow algorithims
	This will cause mass balance errors if baseflow > 0.0
12) hydroweather actually calculates the T/P for each day at the river mouth
	need to create the routine to calculate T/P for each hypsim bin
13) explicitly switch to doubles
	does #define rnd(a)  ((fmod(a,1.0)>(0.5)?((float)((int)(a)+1)):((float)((int)(a)))))
		in HydroParams.h need to be doubled
	can floats in hydroran2 and funct be switched to doubles (no)
14) include hydrofunct in glossary
15) write the digital version of hydrohypsim
	hypsim file may be in cumulative areas
	areabins are in actual areas
16) Hydroclimate.h: are the following used ??? (NO)
	Qnivalmonth[nmonth], Qrainmonth[nmonth], Qicemonth[nmonth];
	Qgwmonth[nmonth], Qmonth[nmonth], stored, Qraintot, Qnivaltot
    Hydroparams.h: are the following used ???
	ela, bigg, smallg (YES)
	biga[12], smalla[12], bigb, bigc, arbela (NO)
    HydroTimeSer.h: are the following used ???
	tprecip, qbcfwd, qbfrom , qicfwd, qifrom (NO)
	qncfwd, qnfrom, qrcfwd, qrfrom (NO)
17) clean up old variable names in *.h files
19) make sure abs => fabs
21) Make sure to free any arrays that change from year to year or epoch to epoch
22) Make sure to deal with carryover arrays
	HydroTrend sets "wrap" arrays from previous years data
23) HydroGlacial, Should meltday Temp[][] be indexed to elaind ???, line 267
	meltday Temp[][] presently indexed to glacierind (at the toe) [NO]
24) HydroRain: include shoulder routines (Shoulder)	not
	at present no rain is wrapped.
	include distbins timelags (Route)
    HydroGlacial, turned on Route and Shoulder
    HydroSnow, turned on Route and Shoulder
25) removed
26) HydroSnow: Does all the snow melt?
	add a check to HydroSnow for the total amount of snow on August 31
27) remove HydroPrintLog.c
28) remove HydroMassCons.c (now included in HydroSumFlow)
29) fidlog:
	check usage throughout,		Checked, removed were appropriate
						except for DBG locations
	only used for DBG?		NO
30) Change HydroTable
	output summary info to HydroLog
	output daily Q's to hydro.q
	output daily Qs's to hydro.qs
	change documentation
31) Move meltrate from HydroParams.h to Hydro.In
32) Qss < 0.0 in HydroRain????
33) Verify nran is always incremented
	nran used in HydroGlacial
	but not in HydroSnow or HydroRain (except indirectly in T and P)
34) Is the ground water time lag used? (gwtlag, read in)
35) Hardwire SHOULDER and ROUTE when testing is finished.
36) create shoulder or route for GW?
37) Hydroweather.c, if sumt is opposite sign of Tmean than
	monthly T's reverse???
38) Exceedflood causes redudant addition to Qsum's
	partially fixed in HydroTrend.c
39) HydroGlacial, check maxflood maxq algorithm
A.J. Kettner:
41) Calculate Qbar by the mean of daily Q (was first done by the log of Qbar but
	that gave strange mean Qbars when for example the same run was done with the
	lake option on or off (Qbar would vary then with the same precipitation input)).
42) Rewrite the program that the mean of the daily Qs is equal to Qsbar
    by setting a new Qsbar.
43) Make it possible to use arguments when starting program (give output filename)
44) Separate out- input files from code
45) Write output to ASCII files option
46) Fix the program so it can handle again more than 1 epoch
47) Write the rain distribution so that it clusters the raindays more or less
48) Make second binary file, exactly the same as the other output file but swabbed
	so it can be read on a different platform
49) Rebuild hypsometeric readin sub routine so it can handel multiple epoch hypso 
	input.
53)	HydroRain.c was not working properly when lake option in input file was turned on.
	Repaired again, and again, changed back.
40) Add code to allow for input of real Precipitation & temperature time series. 
	Is done. 	
54)	Write used statistic values used for stochastic Qs(i) formula to a file. Is done.
55)	Fix bug in the weather generator. Hydrotrend is not exactly the same daily
	weather, which gives slightly errors in long-term Qsbar. Problem was the way the
	random numbers where generated in hydroWeather.c. Problem solved.
56)	Fix the way Tbar is calculated in hydrosetgeoparams.c For real climate as well
	as for generated climate. Is done.

This file documents the HYDROTREND.C program and it's components. Hydrotrend
has been developed over many years by many different researchers. An attempt
has been made to give appropriate credit. The program started out with the
name "river" and was in fortran. Over the years, it's capabilities have
been built upon and greatly expanded to it's present state.  This is the
first C version of the program. It had progressed to river.5.11 in it's
fortran form. The present rewrite was inspired to clean up the structure,
convert to MKS units, add more realistic snow and glacial routines, 
add the ability to simulate large arctic rivers (base flow, time lags ...),
increased error checking (especially between epochs).

Most variables are now in MKS. The input variables are converted immediately
upon reading by the program. The exceptions include many of the precipitation
and evaporation parameters (which are in m/day) and some of the annual values
(in x/year).

			for each altitude bin.  Also calculates the

			and precipitation routines, calculates the
			annual peak flood.
			Also Checks for mass conservations in:
			precipitation, snow and glacial volume.
  HydroSwap.c	Is a swaproutine for the binary output file. When output
  			is all written to the binary output file, a second file will
  			be created as a copy of the original binary output file but the
  			bit order is swabbed so it is also readable on other platforms.
